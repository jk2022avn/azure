# Isolating Workloads with Namespaces

One of the great features of Kubernetes is that you can run any type of application - many organizations are looking to migrate their whole application landscape onto Kubernetes. That could make operations difficult if there was no way to segregate the cluster so Kubernetes has [namespaces](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/).

Namespaces are Kubernetes resources which are a container for other resources. You can use them to isolate workloads, and how you do the isolation is up to you. You may have a production cluster with a different namespace for each application, and a non-production cluster with namespaces for each environment (dev, test, UAT).

You introduce some complexity using namespaces but they give you a lot of safeguards so you can confidently run multiple workloads on a single cluster without compromising scale or security.

## API specs

- [Namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.20/#namespace-v1-core)

<details>
  <summary>YAML overview</summary>

The basic YAML for a namespace is extremely simple:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: whoami
```

That's it :) The namespace needs a name, and for every resource you want to create inside the namespace, you add the namespace name to that object's metadata:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: whoami
  namespace: whoami
```

Namespaces can't be nested, it's a single-level hierarchy used to partition the cluster.

## Creating and using namespaces

The core components of Kubernetes itself run in Pods and Services - but you don't see them in Kubectl because they're in a separate namespace:

```
kubectl get pods

kubectl get namespaces

kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

> The `-n` flag tells Kubectl which namespace to use; if you don't include it, commands use the default namespace

Everything we've deployed so far has been created in the `default` namespace.

What you'll see in `kube-system` depends on your Kubernetes distribution, but it should include a DNS server Pod.

You can work with system resources in the same way as your own apps, but you need to include the namespace in the Kubectl command.

ðŸ“‹ Print the logs of the system DNS server.

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

```
kubectl logs -l k8s-app=kube-dns

kubectl logs -l k8s-app=kube-dns -n kube-system
```

</details><br />

Adding a namespace to every command is time-consuming, and Kubectl has [contexts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/#kubectl-context-and-configuration) to let you set the default namespace for commands:

```
kubectl config get-contexts

cat ~/.kube/config
```

> Contexts are how you switch between clusters too; the cluster API server details are stored in your kubeconfig file 

You can create a new context to point to a remote cluster, or a specific namespace on a cluster. Contexts include authentication details, so they should be managed carefully.

You can update the settings for your context to change the namespace:

```
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace kube-system
```

All Kubectl commands work against the cluster and namespace in the current context.

ðŸ“‹ Print some Pod details from the system namespace and the default namespace.

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

```
kubectl get po

kubectl logs -l k8s-app=kube-dns 

kubectl get po -n default
```

</details><br />

ðŸ“‹ Switch your context back to the `default` namespace so we don't accidentally do anything dangerous.

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

```
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace default
```

</details><br />

## Deploying objects to namespaces

Object specs can include the target namespace in the YAML. If it is not specified you can set the namespace with Kubectl.

- [sleep-pod.yaml](specs/sleep-pod.yaml) defines a Pod with no namespace, so Kubectl decides the namespace - using the default for the context, or an explicit namespace

ðŸ“‹ Deploy the Pod spec in `labs/kubernetes/namespaces/specs/sleep-pod.yaml` to the default namespace and the system namespace.

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

```
kubectl apply -f labs/kubernetes/namespaces/specs/sleep-pod.yaml -n default

kubectl apply -f labs/kubernetes/namespaces/specs/sleep-pod.yaml -n kube-system

kubectl get pods -l app=sleep --all-namespaces
```

</details><br />

> Namespace access can be restricted with access controls, but in your dev environment you'll have cluster admin permissions so you can see everything.

If you're using namespaces to isolate applications, you'll include the namespace spec with the model and specify the namespace in all the objects:

- [whoami/01-namespace.yaml](specs/whoami/01-namespace.yaml) - defines the namespace
- [whoami/deployment.yaml](specs/whoami/deployment.yaml) - defines a Deployment for the namespace
- [whoami/services.yaml](specs/whoami/services.yaml) - defines Services; the label selectors only apply to Pods in the same namespace as the Service

Kubectl can deploy all the YAML in a folder, but it doesn't check the objects for dependencies and create them in the correct order. Mostly that's fine because of the loosely-coupled architecture - Services can be created before a Deployment and vice-versa. 

But namespaces need to exist before any objects can be created in them, so the namespace YAML is called `01_namespaces.yaml` to ensure it gets created first (Kubectl processes files in order by filename).

```
kubectl apply -f labs/kubernetes/namespaces/specs/whoami

kubectl get svc -n whoami
```

Using namespaces to group applications or environments means your top-level objects (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps) don't need so many labels. You'll work with them inside a namespace so you don't need labels for filtering.

Here's another app where all the components will be isolated in their own namespace:

- [configurable/01-namespace.yaml](specs/configurable/01-namespace.yaml) - the new namespace
- [configurable/configmap.yaml](specs/configurable/configmap.yaml) - ConfigMap with app settings
- [configurable/deployment.yaml](specs/configurable/deployment.yaml) - Deployment which references the ConfigMap. Config objects need to be in the same namespace as the Pod.

ðŸ“‹ Deploy the app and use Kubectl to list Deployments in all namespaces.

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

```
kubectl apply -f labs/kubernetes/namespaces/specs/configurable

kubectl get deploy -A --show-labels
```

</details><br />

You can only use Kubectl with one namespace or all namespaces, so you might want additional labels for objects like Services, so you can list across all namespace and filter by label:

```
kubectl get svc -A -l kubernetes.courselabs.co=namespaces
```

## Namespaces and Service DNS

Networking in Kubernetes is flat, so any Pod in any namespace can access another Pod by its IP address.

Services are namespace-scoped, so if you want to resolve the IP address for a Service using its DNS name you can include the namespace:

- `whoami-np` is a local domain name, so it will only look for the Service whoami-np in the same namespace where the lookup runs
- `whoami-np.whoami.svc.cluster.local` is a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN), which will look for the Service whoami-np in the whoami namespace

Run some DNS queries inside the sleep Pod:

```
# this won't return an address - the Service is in a different namespace:
kubectl exec pod/sleep -- nslookup whoami-np

# this includes the namespace, so it will return an IP address:
kubectl exec pod/sleep -- nslookup whoami-np.whoami.svc.cluster.local
```

> As a best-practice you should use FQDNs to communicate between components. It makes your deployment less flexible because you can't change the namespace without also changing app config, but it removes a potentially confusing failure point.


## Lab

Switching between Kubernetes clusters and namespaces is awkward with the `set-context` commands. Search for a pair of tools called `kubens` and `kubectx` and install them, they'll make life easier when you have multiple clusters and apps to work with.

## Cleanup

```
# deleting a namespace deletes everything inside it:
kubectl delete ns -l kubernetes.courselabs.co=namespaces

# which just leaves the sleep Pods:
kubectl delete po -A -l kubernetes.courselabs.co=namespaces
```
