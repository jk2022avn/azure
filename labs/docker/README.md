# Docker 101

How would you run a .NET app on Azure? You could provision a VM, then connect to it and install .NET, download your app binaries, set up the configuration and start the app. It's hard to automate all those steps, time-consuming to spin up a new instance and difficult to keep multiple instances in sync. Or you could use App Service, but there's still a lot to set up and you end up with a different hosting environment than you have locally.

Enter Docker - where you build all your application components and depdencies into a package called an _image_ and use that to run instances of your apps called _containers_.

## Reference

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) - the easiest way to run containers on your local machine
- [Getting Started guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) from Docker
- [.NET container images](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet) - .NET Core & 6 cross-platform images
- [.NET Framework container images](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-framework) - .NET 3.5 & 4.8 Windows images

## Run an .NET web container

We'll run containers locally first and later see our options for running them in Azure. Make sure you have Docker Desktop running - you'll see the Docker whale icon in your taskbar (if you're running on Windows and you've used Docker Desktop before, be sure you're in Linux container mode).

You use the `docker` command to run and manage containers. It has built-in help text, just like the `az` command:

```
docker --help
```

The command you'll use most to start with is `docker run` which starts a new container from an image. Run this command to start a simple web server in a container:

```
docker run -d -p 8081:80 nginx:alpine 
```

You'll see lots of output, ending with a long random string which is the unique ID of your new container. What has the command done?

- it runs a container from the `nginx:alpine` Docker image, which is publicly available and free to use. It has the Nginx web server installed and configured on an Alpine Linux OS base

- the `-d` flag puts the container in the background, so it carries on running when the command returns

- `-p` publishes a port on the container, so Docker can route network traffic into the container. For this container Docker will listen on port `8081` of your machine and send any traffic into port `80` of the container.


> Now browse to http://localhost:8081 and you'll see a response from your new web server.

You use other `docker` commands to manage your container apps:

```
# list running containers:
docker ps

# get the logs from a container:
docker logs <container-id>
```

ðŸ“‹ Run another container from Microsoft's **ASP.NET sample app** image - you can search for it on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com). Run your ASP.NET container in the background and publish port `8082` from your machine to port `80` in the container.

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

Search for _.NET_ on Docker Hub and you'll find a page that lists all the images, including [ASP.NET](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-aspnet/). That shows you there's a sample app in the image called `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/samples:aspnetapp`.

```
docker run -d -p 8082:80 mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/samples:aspnetapp
```

</details><br/>

> When your new container is running, browse to http://localhost:8082

Is your Nginx app still running? What version of .NET is inside the container? Can you print the logs from the ASP.NET sample app?

## Runtime & SDK images

Microsoft owns the Docker images for .NET and it publishes different variations - you've seen ASP.NET for web apps, there are also runtime images for console apps, and SDK images you can use to build applications.

You can run a container interactively, so you connect to a shell session in the container. This is like creating a VM in the cloud and running SSH to connect.

Run an interactive container from the base ASP.NET image and you can explore the environment:

```
docker run -it --entrypoint sh mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0

dotnet --list-runtimes

dotnet --list-sdks

exit
```

You'll see the .NET and ASP.NET runtimes are installed, but there are no SDKs. You can use this image to run compiled apps, but not to build apps from source code.

ðŸ“‹ Run an interactive container from the .NET 6.0 **SDK** image, which you can find on Docker Hub. Use it to create and run a new console application.

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

There's a separate image for the [.NET SDK](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-sdk/):

```
docker run -it --entrypoint sh mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0
```

That gives you a shell session inside the container, which has the .NET 6.0 runtime and SDK installed.

Now you can create and run an app:

```
dotnet new console -o labs-docker

cd labs-docker

dotnet run
```

</details><br/>

When you run the new app you'lll see the standard _Hello, World!_ output. If this reminds you of the Azure Cloud Shell experience, those shell sessions actually run in containers behind the scenes.

Run `exit` to leave the interactive container and come back to your terminal session.

## Build .NET apps in containers

Building apps inside a container is a good way of experimenting, but the real value of Docker is in packaging your own Docker images:

- this [Dockerfile](/src/simple-web/Dockerfile) is a script which packages an ASP.NET app in Docker. It uses the SDK image to build the app and the ASP.NET image to run the app.

There's a lot more you can do with Dockerfiles, but this is a good start. You can build and run a .NET 6.0 app without installing .NET 6.0 on your machine.

Run this to build an image called `simple-web` from the Dockerfile and the source code:

```
docker build -t simple-web src/simple-web
```

You'll see Docker print the output from `dotnet` commands, building and compiling the app..

ðŸ“‹ Run a background container from the new image and publish port `8083` from your machine to port `80` in the container.

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

It's the same `docker run` command.

The image name can be a reference to Docker Hub or Microsoft's container registry, or to a local image:

```
docker run -d -p 8083:80 simple-web 
```

</details><br/>

> Browse to http://localhost:8083 to see the app

The app is very simple, but you can improve it. Edit code in the `src/simple-web/src` folder and run the build command again to package up your changes. Test it by running a new container - you can't repeat the same `docker run` command though - why is that?

## Lab

Container images are static packages - they're really just ZIP files with all your application binaries and dependencies, the runtime and operating system tools. Image names often include a version number, and you can publish different images for different versions of your app. Wherever you run a container from the image, the app will always behave in the same way, because the starting point is always the same.

Typically things change between environments, so you need a way to inject configuration settings into the app when you run a container. The simplest way to do that is with _environment variables_, which you can set when you run the container and get read by the .NET configuration system. The simple web app uses a config setting to show the environment name - run a new container listening on port `8084` which shows the environment name `PROD` on the homepage.

## Cleanup

You'll have lots of containers running, but containers are intended to be disposable.

Run this command to remove them all:

```
docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)
```
